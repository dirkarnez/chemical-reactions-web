1. Find the form of the element in "Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP)", for example hydrogen is "H2" in STP.
2. Identify the [types of chemical reaction](https://byjus.com/chemistry/types-of-chemical-reactions/), for example:
   - Combination reaction (`A + B ‚Üí AB`)
   - Decomposition reaction (`AB ‚Üí A + B`)
3. Now calcuate the product (compound). 
    - Combination reaction (`A + B ‚Üí AB`)
      1. Copy LHS (`A`, `B`) and "sum" to RHS (`AB`)
         - `H2 + O2 = H2O2`
      2. Remove bonds of RHS
         - `H2 + O2 = HO`
      3. Look up valency of `A`, `B` on periodic table. Valency can be calculated by 
         - `H` has 1 valence electrons (number of electrons in outermost shell), need 1 (aka valency) more to complete outermost shell (2) 
         - `O` is 6 valence electrons, need 2 more to complete outermost shell (8)
      4. Using cross method on their valencies, `HO` is corrected to `H2O`
         - `H"2" + O"2" = H"2"O`
      5. Balance the equation using [`index.html`](index.html)
         1. `balance(2, 2, 2, 1); // hidden 1 from oxygen`
            - returns `2 1 2`
         2. `H2 + O2 = H2O` becomes `2H2 + O2 = 2H2O`

> When calculating the product of a chemical reaction, the starting materials and their coefficients are used to determine the number of moles of each reactant. The coefficients of the reactants are multiplied by their respective molar masses, and the products are added together. This calculation yields the mass of the product. The mass of the product is then divided by the molar mass of the product to determine the number of moles of product. The number of moles of product is then multiplied by Avogadro's number to calculate the number of molecules of product.
