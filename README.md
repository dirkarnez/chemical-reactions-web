1. Find the form of the element in "Standard Temperature and Pressure (STP)", for example hydrogen is "H2" in STP.
2. Identify the [types of chemical reaction](https://byjus.com/chemistry/types-of-chemical-reactions/), for example:
   - Combination reaction (`A + B ‚Üí AB`)
   - Decomposition reaction (`AB ‚Üí A + B`)
3. Now calcuate the product (compound). 
    - Combination reaction (`A + B ‚Üí AB`)
      1. Copy LHS (`A`, `B`) and "sum" to RHS (`AB`)
         - `H2 + O2 = H2O2`
      2. Remove bonds of RHS
         - `H2 + O2 = HO`
      3. Look up valency of `A`, `B` on periodic table. Valency can be calculated by 
         - `H` has 1 valence electrons (number of electrons in outermost shell), need 1 (aka valency) more to complete outermost shell (2) 
         - `O` is 6 valence electrons, need 2 more to complete outermost shell (8)
      4. Using cross method on their valencies, `HO` is corrected to `H2O`
         - `H"2" + O"2" = H"2"O`
      5. Balance the equation using [`index.html`](index.html)
         1. `balance(2, 2, 2, 1); // hidden 1 from oxygen`
            - returns `2 1 2`
         2. `H2 + O2 = H2O` becomes `2H2 + O2 = 2H2O`
